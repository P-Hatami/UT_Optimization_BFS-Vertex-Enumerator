# UT_Optimization_BFS-Vertex-Enumerator
A dual-component MATLAB project for Linear Programming: Featuring a robust Vertex Enumeration solver for identifying Basic Feasible Solutions (BFS) and a comprehensive Performance Benchmarking tool. Includes statistical analysis (Mean/Geometric Mean) of execution time complexity as the constraint space scales.
